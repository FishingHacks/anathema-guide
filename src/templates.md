# Templates

Anathema has a template language to describe user interfaces.
This makes it possible to ship the template(s) together with the binary so the
application can be customised even after it's compiled.

The widget syntax looks as follows:

```
  Widget name                                         
  |    Start of attributes
  |    |    Attribute name                            
  |    |    |          Attribute value
  |    |    |          |     Attribute separator      End of attributes
  |    |    |          |     |                        | Values / Text
  |    |    |          |     |                        | |
  |    |    |          |     |                        | |------+-+-+
  |    |    |          |     |                        | |      | | |
widget [optional: "attribute", separated: "by a comma"] "text" 1 2 ident
```
## Attributes

Widget attributes are optional.

Attributes consists of a collection of `ident`, `:`, and `value` (more about
values in the next section).

An `ident` has to start with a letter (`a-zA-Z`) and can contain one or more `_`.

Example:
```
widget [attribute_a: "some string", attribute_b: false]
```

An attribute name is always an ident, however the value can be anything.

## Values

A value can be one of the following:

* string:   `"Empty vessel, under the sun"`
* integer:  `123`
* float:    `1.23`
* boolean:  `true` or `false`
* list:     `[1, 2, 3]`
* map:      `{"key": "value"}`
* ident:    `state_value`

Idents are used to access state values.

## Widgets and children

Some widgets can have one or more children.

Example: a border widget with a text widget inside
```
border
    text "look, a border"
```

## Loops

Given a collection it's possible to loop over the elements of the collection.
The syntax for loops are `for <element> in <collection>`.

Example: looping over static values
```
for value in [1, 2, "hello", 3]
    text value
```

Widgets generated by the loop can be thought of as belonging to the parent
widget as the loop it self is not a widget.

Example: mixing loops and widgets
```
vstack
    text "start"
    for val in list
        text "some value: " val "."
    text "end"
```

Note: For-loops does not work inside attributes, and can only produce
widgets.

## If / Else

It's possible to use `if` and `else` to determine what to layout.

Example:
```
if true
    text "It's true!"
    
if value > 10
    text "Larger than ten"
else if value > 5
    text "Larger than five but less than ten"
else
    text "It's a small value..."
```

### Operators

* Equality `==` 
* Greater than `>`
* Greater than or equals `>=`
* Less than `<`
* Less than or equals `<=`
* And `&&`
* Or `||`

Note: just like for-loops it's not possible to use if/else with attributes.
