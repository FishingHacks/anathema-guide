# Introduction

Anathema is a library for building text user interfaces.

This guide is for the current main branch: https://github.com/togglebyte/anathema

Anathema was created with the intent to give developers a fast and easy way to
write text user interfaces and ship the template(s) along with the application
giving the end user the means and freedom to modify the layout.

## Why

* Templates can be shipped with the application, giving the end user the ability
  to customise the entire layout of the application.
* Easy to prototype with the markup language and runtime.
