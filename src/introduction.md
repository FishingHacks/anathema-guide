# Introduction

Anathema is a library for building text user interfaces.

Anathema was developed with the intent to give developers a fast and easy way to
write text user interfaces.

## What's point of this?

* Templates can be shipped with the application, giving the end user the ability
  to customise the entire layout of the application.
* Easy to prototype with the markup language and runtime.

## Only include what you need:
* Renderer only: tools for drawing in the terminal
* Widgets + renderer: Ready made widgets that can be created and controlled with
  Rust.
* Templates and runtime: Write layouts in a simple to use language
